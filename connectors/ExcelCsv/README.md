# Read cells from Excel files

The code in this section reads data from Excel files (xlsx or csv) and sends it to BVD.
Row and column number are used as the dimensions to assign cell values to BVD data channels.
Additionally a tag 'Excel' is part of the data channel name to help isolate this data from other data during the data binding process.
